# RoLight-Server-finder

# use instructions
- open the roblox page
- upon opening, you will see a small draggable window on the bottom right of your screen
- to use it go to any game and go to the servers tab
- in there under every server you will see a small 8 character code (example: XXXX-XXXX)
- copy the code and enter it into the Server JobId
- pick your own region (optional)
- click fetch and after that you will get the detailed info about the server
- to view last 3 searched servers open the search log at the bottom

the exstention will get upgrades in the future, for now its just a simple singular server viewer

**NEXT UPDATE:**
- new mode: server searching (different from region searching)
you will be able to search directly for servers in a specific game
